# Soccer-Calculator
A calculator with basic arithmetic operations and a "Soccer Mode" feature to predict future soccer statistics.

This calculator has the 4 basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). There is a feature called "Soccer Mode" in which you can predict soccer statistics for a single season. You can predict the amount of goals a player will score in a season as well as assists, clean sheets, or points for a team. These are all done by calculating the average based on games played and games remaining.

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
